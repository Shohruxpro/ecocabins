Sustainable tiny houses

An ecologically tiny house is built as much as possible from sustainable natural materials



We aim to continuously develop and innovate the EcoCabins, so that the EcoCabins are ultimately 100% sustainable and circular. The condition for this is that the EcoCabins remain affordable. With the help of the sun, the wind and the best insulation you can enjoy.

All EcoCabins have a high insulation value, are produced with sustainable and / or natural materials if possible and have the 'round corners' as a striking external feature, made possible by the specific use of materials. The advantages of building.
